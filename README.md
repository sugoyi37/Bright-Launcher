# Bright Launcher
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the Github page of our Bright Launcher, here is the README page, where you can check our usage instructions, precautions, etc.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm really honored to release our Bright Launcher, which is our attempt at graphics, and it's undoubtedly been a success, whether it's switching screens, and pictures , music (Sony Playstation 4 music, we do not have commercial) playback.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried in Scratch 3.0, but it ended in failure, and then I still wrote C++ programs by myself, but whether the console program is single is not in line with modern contrived ideas and concepts , Until recently, when we were building a website, I would think of a website that was converted to Scratch 3.0 using NWJS, so I started to try it. Html is undoubtedly the best choice for people who have not learned graphical programming. I also have to thank HTML5UP for the templates provided by my website and launcher. The crash course of HTML gave me the sense of accomplishment that I had learned a new language. Time really flies. Since I was new to programming in 2019, I still only knew Pascal. I also learned to win awards in competitions. When I was bored, I would write my own programs. At that time, I wrote Bright-North The prototype of the Launcher (very early version, but after 2020), the console, the input serial number into the module, at the time I remember I also made guessing games, all kinds; soon three years later, when I look back When I did, I really found that I had made a lot of progress. The next semester will be the third year of junior high. I will face the first challenge in my life - the middle school entrance examination. I know that I will put down some of my projects and meet the exam, so the development speed will be very slow in the future. Tried Qt, C#, Python again and again, and failed again and again, but I didn't give up... Thank you for reading this
